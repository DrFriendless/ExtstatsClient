    This table implements an analysis <A href="https://boardgamegeek.com/image/1247651/randy-cox">designed by Randy Cox</A>.
    For each month since you really got into games, how many games did you play? The values are coloured according to the number of games played.

  <P>Note that this table includes plays before 2005, so the total may not be the same as the other temporal hotness tables.</P>
